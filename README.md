# Object-Oriented-Programming-and-Methodology
This repository contains some basic programs of C++ that depict the OOPS Concepts.

## ‚ú®*Object-oriented programming* ‚ú®‚Äì 
As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.
Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts.

### ‚≠ê C++ OOPs Concepts‚≠ê
- The major purpose of C++ programming is to introduce the concept of object orientation to the C programming language.
- Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism etc.
### ‚òÄCharacteristics of an Object Oriented Programming language‚òÄ

- **Object :** Object means a real word entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.
- **Class :** Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
- **Inheritance :** When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
- **Polymorphism :** When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.In C++, we use Function overloading and Function overriding to achieve polymorphism.
- **Abstraction :** Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.In C++, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
- **Encapsulation :** Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.

## üåü *Advantages of OOPs over Procedure-Oriented Programming languages (POPs)* üåü
- OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows.
- OOPs provide data hiding whereas in Procedure-oriented programming language a global data can be accessed from anywhere.
- OOPs provide ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.
